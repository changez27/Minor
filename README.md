Description: The model uses Google's Inception ResNet v2 pre-trained model for feature extraction. The model uses Tensorflow,           Keras, Scikit-Image and Numpy libraries for image processing. The model is currently trained on face images to color b/w face images. The results of the model can vary based on the trained imges.
